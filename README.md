# Language Modelling: Rick and Morty

To run the main file "Language_Modeling_Rick_and_Morty", change the paths for loading data to where you have located your txt. files.
To adjust hyperparameters, you are only required to make changes to one block of code defining all the hyperparameters.

If you want to run the code with PTB you will also have to modify the chunk tokenizing the data, OR running the second uploaded file "Model with PTB".

Enjoy.
