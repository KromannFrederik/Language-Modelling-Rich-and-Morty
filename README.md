# Language Modelling: Rich and Morty

To run this file, change the paths for loading data to where you have located your txt. files.
To adjust hyperparameters, you are only required to make changes to one block of code defining all the hyperparameters.

If you want to run the code on PTB you will also have to modify the chunk tokenizing the data.

Enjoy.
